# ThinBing
Super light weight app for getting the latest Bing Desktop wallpapers

ThinBing will grab the latest Bing Desktop wall paper and set it for you. It will then re-check every 4hrs and on log-in.

To "uninstall" (aka, remove the start up reg key) run: "thinbing.exe -d"

Requires .Net 4.5 (It probably could be lower than this, but I am too lazy to check)
