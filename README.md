# ThinBing
The super light weight app for getting the latest Bing Desktop wallpapers!

ThinBing will grab the latest Bing Desktop wallpaper and set it for you. It will then re-check every 4hrs and on log-in.

Simply run thinbin.exe and as if by magic, beautiful wallpapers will adorn you desktop wallpaper!

If you decide you no longer like looking at pretty pictures, simply run "thinbing.exe -d" and it will vanish into oblivion :(

Requires .Net 4.5 (It probably could be lower than this, but I am too lazy to check) and uses only native .NET assemblies
